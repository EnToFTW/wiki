## Using the wiki

To the left is the navigation pane which links all of the pages together. If you are looking for something specific, you can use the search box above, which searches page titles and their content. On the right of the page is the table of contents which shows where on a page you are and can be used to jump to a specific section.

??? note "Note for mobile viewers"
	The left and right sidebars may not appear on smaller devices. On mobile devices you must click on the "hamburger" menu icon at the top left on the screen to see the navigation pane. Clicking on the page you are already on will open the contents panel.
