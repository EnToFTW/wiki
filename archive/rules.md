# Rules

The rules listed on this page apply to **all** members of the community on all official platforms (Minecraft, [Discord](https://discord.left4craft.org) etc).

## General rules

It is up to the highest ranking staff member online at the time to decide if/what rules have been broken and what should happen. If you believe someone is/has broken rules, please alert staff.

### Be respectful to all staff and players

1. Harassment/bullying will not be tolerated
2. Do not demand/beg staff or players to do things for you
3. Please do not ask for staff ranks unless you are using the official application format - all staff earn their position through hard work and commitment
5. Constant negative attitude may lead to being muted or banned

### Use in-game chat appropriately

1. Refrain from swearing -- serious explicit language will not be tolerated
2. Use English whenever possible to communicate with players
3. Use /msg /r /tell for PM or for confidential chatter, and not for advertising. Private messages are logged, and may be looked at if necessary
4. Don't repeating your self more than necessary (spam)
5. No Advertising. Instant permanent mute. If you would like to be un-muted, use the [appeal](https://left4.cf/appeal) form
6. Do not spam mentions (eg. `@Staff`)

### Building

1. Griefing is not allowed, it is considered a serious offence and you will be punished (we have world interaction logs)
2. Raiding (taking) is not allowed. Although possible, items may not be restored to prevent duplication
3. If someone griefs you, alert staff in-game or on [Discord](https://discord.left4craft.org) (`@Staff`)
4. If you have found an area that is obviously player built but not claimed, leave it alone. Finding it doesn't make it yours.
5. Staff have the right to remove any construction they deem to be inappropriate
6. Possession of illegal blocks can result in a perm ban.

### PvP appropriately

1. PvP is enabled. However, all players must agree to fight. If not, there will be consequences
2. All players must agree to fight or you lose your right to keep items you won. Enough infractions equal severe punishment
3. Loot dropped in a PVP-allowed situation may be taken unless otherwise instructed
4. Intentionally using or allowing mobs to kill a player constitutes PvP

### Do not use hacks/cheats or exploit glitches, including (but not limited to):

1. Any unintended method of duplication
2. Any minimap mod
3. Using a hacked client of any kind
4. Accepting any inappropriately obtained items
5. Any type of xray mod or resource pack

!!! note
	Client modifications such as Optifine and LabbyMod are allowed.

### Discrimination Policy

1. Discrimination based on sex/ethnicity/age/nationality/religion is prohibited and is punishable by a one month ban, a second offense is a permanent ban (not appeal-able)
2. Expressing extreme dislike of others based on age/viewpoint/server rank is punishable by a two-week ban, second offense is a permanent ban (appealable)

### Account rules

1. It's your responsibility to keep your account safe
2. Anything your account does, you are responsible for
3. Refrain from using an explicit user skin
4. You may appeal once if you have been punished, appealing a second time may lead to further punishment
5. You may not use an alternate account for afk uses

### Teleportation rules
